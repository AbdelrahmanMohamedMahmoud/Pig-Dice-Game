# Pig-Dice-Game
Welcome to the Pig Dice Game! This repository contains the code for a simple yet exciting dice game where two players compete to reach a set score (typically 100 points) first. The game is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.


Game Rules
 Players: The game is designed for 2 players.

Gameplay:
  - Players take turns rolling a single die.
  - Each roll adds the value of the die to the player's current score for that turn.
  - Players can roll the die as many times as they wish during their turn.
  -If a player rolls a 1, their current score for the turn is lost, and their turn ends.
  -Players can choose to "hold" their score at any time, adding their current score to their total score and ending their turn.

Winning the Game:
 - The first player to reach or exceed the target score (typically 100 points) in their total score wins the game.
